    Welcome to my personal space where I occasionally write about music, thoughts, and other interests.
  </p>

  <h2>Music Blog</h2>
  <p>
    Lately, I’ve been exploring a mix of electronic, experimental, and jazz-inspired music.
    Here’s a small selection of albums and tracks that have caught my attention:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Biosphere – Substrata</strong>: atmospheric ambient masterpiece.</li>
    <li><strong>Boards of Canada – Music Has the Right to Children</strong>: nostalgic, layered textures.</li>
    <li><strong>Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me</strong>: intricate, poetic storytelling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    More detailed thoughts and reviews will appear here as I continue to explore.
